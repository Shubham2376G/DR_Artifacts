# DDR-Augmented-Artifacts

This repository provides **artifact-overlay augmented samples** of the **DDR (Diabetic Retinopathy) dataset**, along with scripts to simulate artifacts and a sample **ResU-Net** model to demonstrate artifact removal.The provided model is a small example to illustrate its use.

---

## üîó Original Dataset

The raw DDR dataset must be downloaded separately:
[DDR Dataset GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nkicsl/DDR-dataset)

> Paper citation: Li et al., *Information Sciences*, 2019.

After downloading DDR, you can use our augmentation scripts to generate artifact-overlaid images or use the sample augmented images provided. The sample augmented images (1,000) are available at **augmentations/output**.

## üìÇ Repository Contents

* `augmentations/` ‚Äî scripts and configuration to **create artifact overlays** on DDR images
* `preprocessing/` ‚Äî contains:

  * **ResU-Net model** to remove artifacts
  * **Model weights** 
  * **Training scripts** (`train.py`)
  * **Inference scripts** (`inference.py`)
  * **Example outputs** comparing input (with artifact) vs output (cleaned) images
* `CITATION.bib` ‚Äî how to cite the original dataset and this augmentation work
* `LICENSE` ‚Äî MIT license

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

1. Download and extract the **original DDR dataset** into the `data/` folder
2. Use the augmentation scripts in `augmentations/` to generate artifact-overlaid images on your own copy of DDR
3. To remove artifacts using our sample ResU-Net model:

   * Download the model weights from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ukObjOJXl4bBVmqzkjx3j7LEufeVS8mS/view?usp=sharing) and place them in `preprocessing/`
   * Run `preprocessing/scripts/inference.py` to generate cleaned images
   * Example outputs are saved in `preprocessing/output/`
4. Training scripts in `preprocessing/scripts/train.py` allow retraining the ResU-Net model on your own augmented dataset

> Note: The **dataset is the main focus**; the provided model is a small demo to illustrate how the dataset can be used for artifact removal.
